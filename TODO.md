# TODO List

This repository contains a program leveraging AI to assist developers and DevOps engineers in maintaining a structured Docker environment. Below is the list of tasks and goals to achieve.

## Goals and Tasks

### 1. Container Statistics Analysis
- [ ] Develop a system to collect and analyze container statistics.
- [ ] Integrate metrics collection tools (e.g., cAdvisor, Prometheus).
- [ ] Build visual dashboards for monitoring container performance.

### 2. Automatic Resource Adjustment
- [ ] Implement an AI-driven system to adjust container resources dynamically.
- [ ] Define resource thresholds and scaling parameters.
- [ ] Test and validate the adjustment process in real-world scenarios.

### 3. Automated Docker-Compose Generation
- [ ] Design a system to generate `docker-compose.yml` files based on required components.
- [ ] Develop an intuitive input method to specify needed services.
- [ ] Ensure compatibility with existing configurations.

### 4. Automatic Compose Version Updates
- [ ] Implement logic to detect outdated `docker-compose` versions.
- [ ] Automate the update process while preserving custom configurations.
- [ ] Test for compatibility with various Docker versions.

### 5. Docker-Compose Layout Optimization
- [ ] Create a standardized layout for `docker-compose.yml` files.
- [ ] Organize services, networks, and volumes for readability.
- [ ] Ensure adherence to best practices for YAML structure.

### 6. Automated Documentation
- [ ] Build a system to generate documentation reflecting the current `docker-compose` state.
- [ ] Include service descriptions, configurations, and resource allocations.
- [ ] Ensure the documentation updates dynamically when the compose file changes.

### 7. Scalability Towards Multi-OS and Multi-Cloud
- [ ] Design the system to ensure scalability across different operating systems.
- [ ] Adapt the AI-driven solutions for compatibility with major cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- [ ] Implement mechanisms to manage multi-cloud environments efficiently.
- [ ] Validate scalability with both horizontal (container/service count) and vertical (resource upgrades) growth.

## Notes
- The program should prioritize usability, scalability, and maintainability.
- Testing and validation are crucial for each feature to ensure stability.
- Consider user feedback for iterative improvements.
